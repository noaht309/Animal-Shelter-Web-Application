About the Project:

This software is intended to be used by the rescue-animal training company Grazioso Salvare. The software will allow the company to identify potential candidate dogs for animal rescue training. A database of information about animals such as their breed, age, location, etcâ€¦ can be interfaced with by the user via a web application interface on the Dash framework. These two ends are glued together via a python CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) module that allows for interactions between the user and database.
